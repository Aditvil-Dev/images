## Using Minio

The Chainguard Minio image contains the `minio` server binary.
The default entrypoint just runs the `minio` binary without any flags.

```shell
$ docker run cgr.dev/chainguard/minio
NAME:
  minio - High Performance Object Storage

DESCRIPTION:
  Build high performance data infrastructure for machine learning, analytics and application data workloads with MinIO

USAGE:
  minio [FLAGS] COMMAND [ARGS...]

COMMANDS:
  server  start object storage server

FLAGS:
  --certs-dir value, -S value  path to certs directory (default: "/root/.minio/certs")
  --quiet                      disable startup and info messages
  --anonymous                  hide sensitive information from logging
  --json                       output logs in JSON format
  --help, -h                   show help
  --version, -v                print the version

VERSION:
  DEVELOPMENT.2023-03-24T21-41-23Z
```

To start minio in a server configuration, make sure to override the `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variables,
and pass a data volume to the `server` command.

```shell
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/data -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=MYNAME -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=MYPASSWORD cgr.dev/chainguard/minio server /data

## What are Chainguard Images?

[Chainguard Images](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images?utm_source=readmes) are a collection of container images designed for security and minimalism.

Many Chainguard Images are [distroless](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started-distroless/); they contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These images do not even contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview), our Linux _undistro_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Images include:

* Minimal design, with no unnecessary software bloat
* Automated nightly builds to ensure Images are completely up-to-date and contain all available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) (software bills of materials) attesting the provenance of all artifacts within the Image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds))

### `-dev` Variants

As mentioned previously, Chainguard’s distroless Images have no shell or package manager by default. This is great for security, but sometimes you need these things, especially in builder images. For those cases, most (but not all) Chainguard Images come paired with a `-dev` variant which does include a shell and package manager.

Although the `-dev` image variants have similar security features as their distroless versions, such as complete SBOMs and signatures, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. The general recommendation is to use the `-dev` variants only to build the application and then copy all application artifacts into a distroless image, which will result in a final container image that has a minimal attack surface and won’t allow package installations or logins.

That being said, it’s worth noting that `-dev` variants of Chainguard Images are completely fine to run in production environments. After all, the `-dev` variants are still **more secure** than many popular container images based on fully-featured operating systems such as Debian and Ubuntu since they carry less software, follow a more frequent patch cadence, and offer attestations for what they include.
