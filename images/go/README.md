## Compatibility Notes

Where possible, the Go Chainguard Image is built for compatibility with the [Docker official image for Golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/). 

The Go Chainguard Image uses the `glibc` implementation of the C standard library, while the Alpine version of the Golang official Docker Image uses `musl`. See our [article on glibc vs. musl](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/images-compiled-programs/glibc-vs-musl/) on Chainguard Academy for an overview of the differences between these implementations.


The examples in this README recommend executing Go binaries from one of our runtime Chainguard Images, such as the `glibc-dynamic` or `static` Chainguard Images. If using the `static` Chainguard Image, make sure to build your Go binary with static linking. In most cases, this requires running `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build` when building the binary. If dynamic linking is needed, use the `glibc-dynamic` Chainguard Image or the Go Chainguard Image to run your application. 


In Go 1.20, we default to using the new `GODEBUG` settings of `tarinsecurepath=0` and `zipinsecurepath=0`. These can be disabled by clearing the `GODEBUG` environment variable, or by setting them to `1`.

Learn more about these settings in the [Go release notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.20).

## Getting Started

### Example: CLI Application Using Multi-Stage Build

The following build demonstrates a command line application with support for flags and positional arguments. The application prints a modifiable greeting message and provides usage information if the wrong number of arguments are passed by a user or the user passes an unrecognized flag.

First, create a project folder and change the working directory to that folder:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/go-greeter && cd $_
```

Next, ,write a file defining our Go CLI application (`main.go`:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > main.go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func usage() {
	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "usage: hello [options] [name]\n")
	flag.PrintDefaults()
	os.Exit(2)
}

var (
	greeting = flag.String("g", "Hello", "Greet with `greeting`")
)

func main() {
	// Configure logging
	log.SetFlags(0)
	log.SetPrefix("hello: ")

	// Parse flags.
	flag.Usage = usage
	flag.Parse()

	// Parse and validate arguments.
	name := "Linky üêô"
	args := flag.Args()
	if len(args) >= 2 {
		usage()
	}
	if len(args) >= 1 {
		name = args[0]
	}
	if name == "" { // hello '' is an error
		log.Fatalf("invalid name %q", name)
	}

	fmt.Printf("%s, %s!\n", *greeting, name)
}
EOF
```

Create a go.mod` file to list dependencies:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > go.mod
module chainguard.dev/greet

go 1.19
EOF
```

Write a `Dockerfile` to define our image build:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/go AS builder
COPY . /app
RUN cd /app && go build -o go-greeter .

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/static
COPY --from=builder /app/go-greeter /usr/bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/go-greeter"]
EOF
```

The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build approach, compiling the application using the `go` Chainguard Image, then copying the binary to the `static` Chainguard Image for execution. Note that the `static` image requires that the Go binary be statically linked‚Äîif your application requires dynamic linking, consider using the `glibc-dynamic` Chainguard Image for your runtime (see the second example in this README).

Build the image, tagging it `go-greeter`:

```sh
docker build . -t go-greeter
```

Run the image:

```sh
docker run go-greeter
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Hello, Linky üêô!
```

You can also pass in arguments that will be parsed by the Go CLI application: 

```sh
docker run go-greeter -g Greetings "Chainguard user"
```

This will produce the following output:

```
Greetings, Chainguard user!
```

The application will also share usage instructions when prompted with the `--help` flag or when invalid flags are passed.

Because we used the `static` Chainguard Image as our runtime, the final image only requires a few megabytes on disk:


```sh
docker inspect go-greeter | jq -c 'first' | jq .Size | numfmt --to iec --format "%8.4f"
```

The final size, `3.5055M`, is orders of magnitude smaller than it would be running the application using a Go image. However, if your application is dynamically linked to shared objects, consider using the `glibc-dynamic` Chainguard Image for your runtime or take extra steps to build your Go binary statically.

### Example: Web Application

The following build demonstrates an application that's accessible by HTTP server. The application renders a simple message that changes based on the URI.

First, create a project folder and change the working directory to that folder:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/greet-server && cd $_
```

Next, write a `main.go` file defining our web application:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > main.go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"html"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"runtime/debug"
	"strings"
)

func usage() {
	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "usage: helloserver [options]\n")
	flag.PrintDefaults()
	os.Exit(2)
}

var (
	greeting = flag.String("g", "Hello", "Greet with `greeting`")
	addr     = flag.String("addr", "0.0.0.0:8080", "address to serve")
)

func main() {
	// Parse flags.
	flag.Usage = usage
	flag.Parse()

	// Parse and validate arguments (none).
	args := flag.Args()
	if len(args) != 0 {
		usage()
	}

	// Register handlers. for greeting and version
	http.HandleFunc("/", greet)
	http.HandleFunc("/version", version)

	log.Printf("serving http://%s\n", *addr)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(*addr, nil))
}

func version(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	info, ok := debug.ReadBuildInfo()
	if !ok {
		http.Error(w, "no build information available", 500)
		return
	}

	fmt.Fprintf(w, "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<pre>\n")
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s\n", html.EscapeString(info.String()))
}

func greet(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	name := strings.Trim(r.URL.Path, "/")
	if name == "" {
		name = "Linky üêô"
	}

	fmt.Fprintf(w, "<!DOCTYPE html>\n")
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s, %s!\n", *greeting, html.EscapeString(name))
}
EOF
```

Next, write a `go.mod` file listing dependencies:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > go.mod
module chainguard.dev/greet-server

go 1.19
EOF
```

Write a `Dockerfile` to define our image build:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' > Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/go AS builder
COPY . /app
RUN cd /app && go build

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/glibc-dynamic
COPY --from=builder /app/greet-server /usr/bin/

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/greet-server"]
EOF
```

The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build approach, compiling the application using the `go` Chainguard Image, then copying the binary to the `glibc-dynamic` Chainguard Image to serve.

Build the image, tagging it `greet-server`:

```sh
docker build . -t greet-server
```

Run the image:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 greet-server
```

Visit [http://0.0.0.0:8080/](http://0.0.0.0:8080/) using a web browser on your host machine. You should see the following:

```
Hello, Linky üêô!
```

Changes to the URI will be routed to the application. Try visiting [http://0.0.0.0:8080/Chainguard%20Customer](http://0.0.0.0:8080/Chainguard%20Customer). You should see the following output:

```
Hello, Chainguard Customer!
```

The application will also share version information at [http://0.0.0.0:8080/version](http://0.0.0.0:8080/version).

If you're building a web application with Go, consider the [nginx](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/nginx/overview) Chainguard Image for use as a reverse proxy.

## What are Chainguard Images?

[Chainguard Images](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images?utm_source=readmes) are a collection of container images designed for security and minimalism.

Many Chainguard Images are [distroless](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started-distroless/); they contain only an open-source application and its runtime dependencies. These images do not even contain a shell or package manager. Chainguard Images are built with [Wolfi](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/overview), our Linux _undistro_ designed to produce container images that meet the requirements of a secure software supply chain.

The main features of Chainguard Images include:

* Minimal design, with no unnecessary software bloat
* Automated nightly builds to ensure Images are completely up-to-date and contain all available security patches
* [High quality build-time SBOMs](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) (software bills of materials) attesting the provenance of all artifacts within the Image
* [Verifiable signatures](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/working-with-images/retrieve-image-sboms/) provided by [Sigstore](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/an-introduction-to-cosign/)
* Reproducible builds with Cosign and apko ([read more about reproducibility](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/reproducing-chainguards-reproducible-image-builds))

### `-dev` Variants

As mentioned previously, Chainguard‚Äôs distroless Images have no shell or package manager by default. This is great for security, but sometimes you need these things, especially in builder images. For those cases, most (but not all) Chainguard Images come paired with a `-dev` variant which does include a shell and package manager.

Although the `-dev` image variants have similar security features as their distroless versions, such as complete SBOMs and signatures, they feature additional software that is typically not necessary in production environments. The general recommendation is to use the `-dev` variants only to build the application and then copy all application artifacts into a distroless image, which will result in a final container image that has a minimal attack surface and won‚Äôt allow package installations or logins.

That being said, it‚Äôs worth noting that `-dev` variants of Chainguard Images are completely fine to run in production environments. After all, the `-dev` variants are still **more secure** than many popular container images based on fully-featured operating systems such as Debian and Ubuntu since they carry less software, follow a more frequent patch cadence, and offer attestations for what they include.
